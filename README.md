## Using it

Drag anywhere to stir the fluid; several fingers work at once. The dock at the bottom has the everyday actions:

| Dock button | What it does | Key |
|---|---|---|
| Presets | Opens the gallery of saved looks | |
| Random | New palette, background, motion and symmetry in one tap | R |
| Controls | Opens the sheet with every setting | |
| Freeze | Stops the motion; you can still paint on the frozen image | F or P |
| Capture | Saves an image (to the gallery in the app, as a download in a browser) | |

In the Controls sheet, drag the handle to resize it or flick it down to close. While you move a slider the sheet turns see-through so you can watch the fluid change. The eye icon hides every control; tap the small arrow at the bottom (or press Back / Esc / H) to bring them back. Undo and redo sit at the top of the sheet.

More keys: Space adds random splats, C next palette, A auto-play, V vortex, M mirror, K kaleidoscope, T trails, B blacklight, N rainbow, I random color per touch, G / J / X cycle the gesture mode, injection mode and force field, O toggles particles, L cycles the particle style, Q cycles the simulation mode, Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z undo and redo.

## Settings

Every setting from the original control panel is still here, now grouped into the tabs of the Controls sheet (Scene, Touch, Look, Physics, Particles, Text, System). Sliders run from 0 to 100% and each is mapped to a tuned engine value. What each group contains:

- **Presets:** choose a preset (six built in: Default, Aurora Dream, Lava Lamp, Neon Party, Ink on Paper, Starry Galaxy), rename it, save, new, clone, random, export (copy, share or download as JSON), load (paste or open a JSON file), delete, and reset simulation. Presets are saved on this device, and the last one you used opens next time. Undo and redo (also Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z) step through settings changes.
- **Reacts to** (Scene tab): what the fluid follows besides your fingers.
  - **Sound reactive:** the microphone drives the fluid: loudness stirs it and brightens the glow, high notes brighten the particles, and a beat in the bass bursts and spins it. Sensitivity, bass pulse, stirring, glow and sparks are each adjustable. Nothing is recorded. The microphone is released whenever the app is out of sight; on the live wallpaper it is only used if System → App → "Microphone on the live wallpaper" is on.
  - **Tilt sets gravity:** color pours toward the low side of the phone, with a strength on top of the Gravity setting. **Shake for a burst:** a firm shake sets off a splash of color.
  - **Follow the time of day:** dawn and dusk warm the colors and background, night cools them, the middle of the day is the look itself. **Lighter in light mode:** a paper-light background while the device is in light mode.
  - **Ripple when the screen wakes:** a ring of color from the middle when the screen wakes or the charger goes in. **Colors follow the battery:** nearly flat warms the colors toward fire, charging pulls them toward green.
- **Simulation → simulation mode:** one-tap scenes built from the forces below. Each sets its own forces, fields and edges, and most keep the scene moving on their own:
  - **Standard Fluid** (resets those forces), **Vortex**, **Whirlpool** (color pours in at the rim and drains in the middle), **Tornado** (a rising, twisting column), **Explosion** (periodic bursts), **Fountain** (a jet that arcs and falls), **Waterfall** (falls off the top and out the bottom), **Waves** (a traveling sine ribbon), **Orbit** (planets on Kepler-style orbits), **Magnetic** (color streams along field lines between two poles), **Plasma** (crackling arcs in turbulence), **Galaxy** (two spiral arms around a bright core), **Black Hole** (clouds spiral in and vanish), **Reverse Flow** (fluid moves against your finger)
- **Simulation:** quality (Very Low → Ultra High), speed, autoplay, radius, sim resolution, dissipation (fade time), viscosity, vorticity, gravity, pressure (Low / Norm / Max)
- **Forces:** turbulence (animated curl noise), flow strength, swirl, pressure strength, buoyancy (50% = neutral, lower sinks, higher rises), drag, elasticity (springy wobble), flow direction (8 directions, radial outward/inward, circular), flow speed, randomness
- **Edges:** Wall, Wrap (fluid leaving one side comes back on the other; needs WebGL2), Void (fluid flows out and vanishes), Repel; plus repel strength, repel distance, edge friction, edge bounce, edge softness, and corner behavior (Normal, Rounded, Repel, Bounce, Absorb, Wrap)
- **Touch:** touch force, touch radius, touch attraction, touch repulsion, multi-touch strength (applies while 2+ fingers are down), continuous drawing (keeps adding color while a finger is held still), touch sensitivity (below 50% ignores tiny jitters, above 50% amplifies movement), gesture mode, injection mode
  - **Gesture modes:** Push (classic), Pull (draws color in behind the finger), Swirl (spins fluid around the finger), Attract and Repel (hold to pull color in or push it away), Inject (color with little force), Erase (wipes color away), Vortex (a whirlpool under the finger)
  - **Injection modes:** Continuous, Burst (a ring of color on touch), Pulse (rhythmic bursts), Spray (spray-paint speckles), Fountain (an upward jet), Random (random directions and colors), Directional (a steady jet in the direction you last moved)
- **Forces → force field:** Vortex, Attractor, Repeller, Spiral, Radial (a turning star of rays), Wave (traveling waves), Magnetic (two poles), plus field strength
- **Effects:** shading, bloom, flare (Soft, Sharp, Radial, Cinematic), sunrays, gamma (Standard, Bright, Dark, Cinematic), specular highlights (Soft, Glossy, Sharp), mirror, glow intensity and radius, refraction (glass-like distortion), reflection, transparency, depth (relief lighting and a drop shadow)
- **Blacklight:** blacklight mode, intensity, fluorescence (brightness and glowing edges), UV color mode (Neon Blue, Electric Purple, Fluorescent Pink, Toxic Green, Neon Orange, Ultraviolet, Cyan, Full Spectrum)
- **Filters:** pixels (2×–16×), neon outlines, emboss, lens fringe, film filter (warm grade, vignette, grain), saturation and contrast (50% = unchanged), invert, shake (follows how hard you stir; Subtle, Normal, Strong), motion echoes (Smooth, Fluid, Dramatic) with intensity, chromatic aberration, blur, sharpen, color variation
- **Particles:** particles, mix (0% = fluid only, 50% = both, 100% = particles only), intensity, speed, amount (128 to 16,384), style (Points, Lines, Trails, Circles, Glow, Sparks, Bubbles, Dust, Orbs, Waves), size, length (streak length for moving particles), density (share of particles shown), glow (halo), spread (100% = whole screen, lower = spawn around your finger), turbulence, fade (how quickly each particle disappears), attraction (particles drift toward each other), collision (crowded particles push apart), trails, color mode (Fluid Color, Single Color, Random, Velocity-Based, Rainbow, Gradient from the current palette, Temperature-Based), single color
- **Performance:** performance mode (Battery Saver, Balanced, Performance, Maximum Performance presets), frame rate limit (15–120 FPS or Unlimited), adaptive quality (steps render scale, dye resolution and effect quality down when frames run slow, and back up when they recover), render scale (internal resolution, 0% = 25%), effect quality (bloom, sunrays and glow resolution), particle limit, battery saver (caps at 30 FPS, 70% render scale, Low effects, 1,024 particles), and a live FPS readout
- **Text:** text on/off, text mode (Paint: the letters keep pouring color into the fluid; Obstacle: the fluid flows around solid letters), edit text (multiple lines), font, font size, text color, outline and thickness, text glow and intensity, position x / y, rotation, opacity
- **Background:** Black, White, Transparent (transparent screenshots), Custom (with a color picker) and the gradient presets, plus brightness, blur (a soft out-of-focus copy of the fluid behind it) and opacity
- **Capture:** save image (to the gallery in the app), share image, image size (720p, 1080p, 1440p), transparent background, gentle automatic splashes, start fresh when you come back, hide the controls
- **App:** haptic feedback, keep the screen on, About, Privacy

Simulation speed stays real-time at any frame rate limit: the solver sub-steps long frames, emitters keep their 60-per-second rhythm, and fast strokes are filled in between frames.

Particles run entirely on the GPU and ride the fluid's velocity. They need float textures (WebGL2 on nearly all current phones); devices without them show a message instead.

Screen filters only run while at least one is switched on, so they cost nothing when off. Screenshots capture the fluid without screen filters.

Gravity, buoyancy and flow direction act on the colored fluid, so dense color sinks, rises or drifts while clear areas stay calm. In Wrap and Void modes a directional flow also moves the whole field.

## Develop

Needs Node 20 or newer. The web app has no build step: the files in the repo root are what GitHub Pages serves.

```sh
npm install
npm start          # http://localhost:8080
npm run check      # lint + tests + build (what CI runs)
```

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `script.js` | The engine: simulation, shaders, presets, and the description of every setting |
| `ui.js`, `ui.css` | The interface: dock, sheet, tabs and controls, drawn from that description |
| `native.js` | Platform bridge: haptics, saving and sharing files, Back button; web fallbacks |
| `sw.js`, `manifest.webmanifest` | Offline support and install for the web version |
| `android/` | The Android shell (Capacitor) and the small `RipplDevice` plugin |
| `tests/` | The whole app run in jsdom with a stand-in for WebGL |

### Android app

Every pull request builds a debug APK in GitHub Actions; download it from the run's **Artifacts** and install it on a phone. To build locally you need JDK 21 and the Android SDK:

```sh
npm run android:debug     # android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Releasing to Google Play (signing key, secrets, store listing) is covered in [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md).
